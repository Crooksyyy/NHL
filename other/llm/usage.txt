Can we format the names better in the cleaned data for example make p into Points and G into Goals etc

2 / 2

ChatGPT
Sure, we can rename the columns to make them more descriptive. Here's how you can do it:

R
Copy code
# Rename the columns for better readability
names(cleaned_data) <- c("Player", "Position", "GamesPlayed", "Goals", "Assists", "Points", "PlusMinus", "PointsPerGame", "TimeOnIcePerGame", "Salary", "CapHit")

# Display the first few rows of the cleaned data with renamed columns
head(cleaned_data)
This code will rename the columns as follows:

"GP" will be renamed to "GamesPlayed"
"G" will be renamed to "Goals"
"A" will be renamed to "Assists"
"P" will be renamed to "Points"
"P/GP" will be renamed to "PointsPerGame"
"TOI/GP" will be renamed to "TimeOnIcePerGame"
Now, the column names in the cleaned dataset are more descriptive. Let me know if you need further assistance!

User
drop players with missing data
ChatGPT
To drop players with missing data, you can use the na.omit() function in R. Here's how you can do it:

R
Copy code
# Drop rows with missing data
cleaned_data <- na.omit(cleaned_data)

# Display the first few rows of the cleaned data after dropping rows with missing data
head(cleaned_data)
This will remove any rows in the cleaned_data dataframe that contain missing values in any column. After running this code, you'll have a dataset without any missing data. Let me know if you need further assistance!

User
how to check variable types 
ChatGPT
To check the variable types in R, you can use the str() function, which displays the structure of an R object. Here's how you can use it:

R
Copy code
# Check variable types
str(cleaned_data)
This will display the structure of the cleaned_data dataframe, including the variable names and their corresponding types. It's a handy way to get an overview of your data types. If you have specific variables you want to check, you can also use the class() function on individual columns:

R
Copy code
# Check the variable type of a specific column
class(cleaned_data$ColumnName)
Replace ColumnName with the name of the column you want to check. This will return the variable type of that specific column. Let me know if you need further clarification!

User
for all columns at once
ChatGPT
To check the variable types for all columns at once in R, you can use the sapply() function along with the class() function. Here's how you can do it:

R
Copy code
# Check variable types for all columns
sapply(cleaned_data, class)
This will return a vector where each element corresponds to the variable type of each column in the cleaned_data dataframe. You'll see the variable types listed for each column.

User
can you think of any other ways we should clean the dataset 
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are some additional ways to clean the dataset:

Handle Duplicate Entries: Check for and remove any duplicate rows in the dataset.
Address Outliers: Examine numerical columns for outliers and decide whether to remove or adjust them based on domain knowledge.
Standardize Categorical Values: If there are categorical variables with multiple representations of the same category (e.g., "Male", "M", "male"), standardize them to a single format.
Handle Missing Values: If there are missing values, decide on the appropriate method to handle them, such as imputation or removal of rows/columns with missing data.
Normalize Numeric Data: If necessary, scale or normalize numerical features to a standard range to prevent bias in machine learning algorithms.
Check for Consistency: Ensure consistency in data entry formats, such as consistent date formats or units of measurement.
Validate Relationships: Validate relationships between variables, such as ensuring that the number of goals scored (G) is less than or equal to the number of games played (GP).
Remove Irrelevant Columns: Remove any columns that are not useful for analysis or modeling.
Ensure Data Integrity: Check for data integrity issues, such as constraints on numerical values (e.g., ensuring that salary values are positive) or logical constraints between variables.
Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing ones that might provide additional insights or improve model performance.
By applying these additional cleaning steps, you can ensure that the dataset is well-prepared for analysis and modeling.

User
can you write a test to test Goals + Assists = Points
ChatGPT
Sure, here's an example of how you could write a test in Python using the unittest module to check whether the sum of goals and assists equals points:

python
Copy code
import unittest

# Function to check if Goals + Assists = Points
def check_goals_assists_points(goals, assists, points):
    return goals + assists == points

# Test case class
class TestGoalsAssistsPoints(unittest.TestCase):

    # Test when goals + assists equals points
    def test_goals_assists_points_equal(self):
        self.assertTrue(check_goals_assists_points(20, 30, 50))  # Example values where 20 goals + 30 assists = 50 points

    # Test when goals + assists does not equal points
    def test_goals_assists_points_not_equal(self):
        self.assertFalse(check_goals_assists_points(15, 25, 40))  # Example values where 15 goals + 25 assists != 40 points

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
This test defines a function check_goals_assists_points that takes three arguments: goals, assists, and points. It checks whether the sum of goals and assists equals points and returns True if they are equal and False otherwise.

The TestGoalsAssistsPoints class inherits from unittest.TestCase and contains two test methods: test_goals_assists_points_equal and test_goals_assists_points_not_equal. These methods use assertions to check whether the check_goals_assists_points function behaves as expected for different input values. If all assertions pass, the tests will succeed; otherwise, they will fail, indicating a problem with the function.

User
using my cleaned data set with the following data names(cleaned_data) <- c("Player", "Position", "GamesPlayed", "Goals", "Assists", "Points", "PlusMinus", "PointsPerGame", "TimeOnIcePerGame", "Salary", "CapHit", test that the goals plus assits equals points 
ChatGPT
Sure, here's how you can write a test to check if the sum of goals and assists equals points using the cleaned data set:

r
Copy code
# Assuming the cleaned data set is named "cleaned_data"

# Load the necessary library
library(testthat)

# Function to check if Goals + Assists = Points
check_goals_assists_points <- function(data) {
  # Calculate the sum of goals and assists
  total_goals_assists <- data$Goals + data$Assists
  
  # Check if the sum of goals and assists equals points
  all(total_goals_assists == data$Points)
}

# Test case
test_that("Goals + Assists = Points", {
  expect_true(check_goals_assists_points(cleaned_data))
})
This test defines a function check_goals_assists_points that takes the cleaned data set as input. It calculates the sum of goals and assists for each player and checks if it equals the points scored by the player. If all players satisfy this condition, the function returns TRUE, indicating that goals plus assists equal points for all players.

The test_that function defines a test case with the description "Goals + Assists = Points". Inside this test case, the expect_true function checks if the check_goals_assists_points function returns TRUE. If the test passes, it means that goals plus assists indeed equal points for all players in the cleaned data set.

User
what other tests can be done on this data sert
ChatGPT
Here are some additional tests you can perform on the cleaned data set:

Check for Missing Values: Ensure that there are no missing values in essential columns like Player, Goals, Assists, Points, etc.
Validity of Player Positions: Verify that the positions assigned to players are valid (e.g., "C" for Center, "LW" for Left Wing, "RW" for Right Wing, "D" for Defense).
Range Checks: Validate that numeric columns such as Games Played, Goals, Assists, Points, Plus/Minus, Points per Game, Time on Ice per Game, Salary, and Cap Hit fall within reasonable ranges (e.g., non-negative values, appropriate salary figures).
Consistency Checks: Ensure consistency between related columns, such as verifying that Points is equal to Goals plus Assists.
Salary vs. Performance: Check if there's any correlation between a player's salary and their performance metrics (e.g., Points, Plus/Minus). This could involve statistical tests or visualizations.
Positional Analysis: Perform analyses specific to player positions, such as comparing average performance metrics between different positions.
Outlier Detection: Identify any outliers in performance metrics and investigate them further to determine if they are valid data points or errors.
Time Trends: Analyze trends over time for performance metrics, salaries, and other variables to identify any patterns or anomalies.
Salary Discrepancies: Check for any discrepancies between the reported salary and cap hit values.
Comparison with External Data: If available, compare the data with external sources or historical data to validate its accuracy and completeness.
Each of these tests contributes to ensuring the quality and reliability of the data set for further analysis or reporting.

User
write tests to ensure no duplicate players
ChatGPT
To ensure there are no duplicate players in the data set, you can perform the following test:

R
Copy code
# Test for duplicate players
if (length(unique(cleaned_data$Player)) == nrow(cleaned_data)) {
  print("No duplicate players found.")
} else {
  print("Duplicate players found.")
}
This test checks if the number of unique player names matches the total number of rows in the data set. If they are equal, it means there are no duplicate players. Otherwise, it indicates that there are duplicate player entries in the data set.

User
write a test to ensure time on ice per game is logical 
ChatGPT
To ensure that the "TimeOnIcePerGame" variable is logical, you can perform the following test:

R
Copy code
# Test for logical values of TimeOnIcePerGame
logical_toig <- cleaned_data$TimeOnIcePerGame >= 0 & cleaned_data$TimeOnIcePerGame <= 60

if (all(logical_toig)) {
  print("TimeOnIcePerGame values are logical.")
} else {
  print("TimeOnIcePerGame values are not logical.")
}
This test checks if all values of "TimeOnIcePerGame" fall within a logical range, typically between 0 and 60 minutes per game. If all values pass this condition, it indicates that the "TimeOnIcePerGame" values are logical. Otherwise, it suggests that there are illogical values present in the data set. Adjust the range as needed based on your domain knowledge.

User
can you write the code to create two scatter plots one of points on the x axis and salary and cap hit on the y axis
ChatGPT
Sure, here's how you can create two scatter plots using the ggplot2 package in R:

R
Copy code
library(ggplot2)

# Scatter plot for Points vs. Salary
ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = Points, y = Salary)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Points vs. Salary",
       x = "Points",
       y = "Salary")

# Scatter plot for Points vs. Cap Hit
ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = Points, y = CapHit)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Points vs. Cap Hit",
       x = "Points",
       y = "Cap Hit")
Replace cleaned_data with the name of your data frame containing the cleaned data. These plots will show the relationship between points and both salary and cap hit. Adjust the labels and titles as needed for your specific visualization requirements.

User
can you make a graph with plusminus on the x-axis and salary on the y-axis. can we also highligh players that position is "D"
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's how you can create a scatter plot with PlusMinus on the x-axis and Salary on the y-axis, highlighting players whose position is "D":

R
Copy code
library(ggplot2)

# Define colors for different positions
position_colors <- c("D" = "blue", "Other" = "black")

# Create the scatter plot
ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = PlusMinus, y = Salary, color = Position)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = position_colors) +  # Color by position
  labs(title = "PlusMinus vs. Salary",
       x = "PlusMinus",
       y = "Salary") +
  theme_minimal()
This plot will show PlusMinus on the x-axis, Salary on the y-axis, and players whose position is "D" will be highlighted in blue. Adjust the colors and labels as needed for your specific visualization preferences.

User
ok same graph but instead can we high light players with lots of points 
ChatGPT
Sure, we can highlight players with lots of points by adjusting the size of the points. Here's how you can do it:

R
Copy code
# Define a threshold for highlighting players with lots of points
points_threshold <- 70  # You can adjust this threshold as needed

# Create the scatter plot with point size based on Points
ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = PlusMinus, y = Salary, color = Position, size = Points > points_threshold)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +  # Adjust transparency for better visualization
  scale_color_manual(values = position_colors) +  # Color by position
  labs(title = "PlusMinus vs. Salary (Highlighted by Points)",
       x = "PlusMinus",
       y = "Salary",
       size = "High Points") +
  theme_minimal()
In this plot, players with points greater than the threshold (points_threshold) will have larger points, making them stand out in the plot. Adjust the threshold as needed to highlight players with different point thresholds.

User
try again this looks bad
ChatGPT
Sure, let's refine the plot to make it more visually appealing:

R
Copy code
# Create a color palette for different positions
position_colors <- c("F" = "blue", "D" = "red")

# Define a threshold for highlighting players with lots of points
points_threshold <- 70  # You can adjust this threshold as needed

# Create the scatter plot with point size based on Points
ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = PlusMinus, y = Salary, color = Position, size = Points > points_threshold)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +  # Adjust transparency for better visualization
  scale_color_manual(values = position_colors) +  # Color by position
  scale_size_manual(values = c(1, 3)) +  # Adjust size of points
  labs(title = "PlusMinus vs. Salary (Highlighted by Points)",
       x = "PlusMinus",
       y = "Salary",
       size = "High Points") +
  theme_minimal()
This plot should look better, with larger points indicating players with lots of points and different colors for different positions. Adjust the size and colors as needed for better visualization.

ChatGPT
To determine which regression analysis to perform on the given data, we need to understand the relationship we want to explore. Here are a few options based on the variables provided:

Predicting Salary or CapHit based on Player Performance: We could use a multiple linear regression model where Salary or CapHit is the dependent variable, and Goals, Assists, Points, PlusMinus, PointsPerGame, and TimeOnIcePerGame are the independent variables. This model would aim to predict a player's salary based on their performance metrics.
Predicting Performance Metrics based on Position: We could perform an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a regression analysis to explore if there's a significant difference in performance metrics (Goals, Assists, Points, etc.) based on a player's position (D or C). This analysis would help determine if there's a difference in player performance between defensemen and centers.
Exploring the Relationship between Performance Metrics: We could perform a correlation analysis to understand the relationship between different performance metrics such as Goals, Assists, Points, etc. This analysis would help identify which metrics tend to correlate strongly with each other.
Predicting PlusMinus based on Performance Metrics: We could perform a simple linear regression analysis where PlusMinus is the dependent variable, and Goals, Assists, Points, PointsPerGame, and TimeOnIcePerGame are the independent variables. This model would aim to predict a player's PlusMinus rating based on their offensive performance and time on ice.
The choice of regression analysis depends on the specific research question or hypothesis you want to investigate with the given data.

User
Predicting Salary or CapHit based on Player Performance, whihc regression should be done
ChatGPT
To predict Salary or CapHit based on Player Performance, you would typically perform a multiple linear regression analysis.

In this regression model:

Dependent Variable: Salary or CapHit (the variable you want to predict)
Independent Variables: Player Performance Metrics (such as Goals, Assists, Points, PlusMinus, PointsPerGame, TimeOnIcePerGame)
The multiple linear regression model equation would look like this:

scss
Copy code
Salary/CapHit = β0 + β1(Goals) + β2(Assists) + β3(Points) + β4(PlusMinus) + β5(PointsPerGame) + β6(TimeOnIcePerGame) + ε
where:

β0, β1, β2, ..., β6 are the coefficients for each independent variable
ε is the error term
The regression analysis will estimate the coefficients (β values) that minimize the difference between the observed Salary or CapHit values and the values predicted by the model based on the player performance metrics.

Once you've built the regression model, you can assess its accuracy and significance, interpret the coefficients, and make predictions about Salary or CapHit for new players based on their performance metrics.

### Model data ####
first_model <-
  stan_glm(
    formula = Salary ~ Points,
    data = analysis_data,
    family = binomial(link = "logit"),
    prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
    prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
    prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),
    seed = 853
  ) write the model in this form
ChatGPT
The provided code snippet appears to be specifying a logistic regression model using the stan_glm() function, which is typically used for binomial outcomes (e.g., classification problems). However, based on your question about predicting Salary or CapHit, which are continuous variables, you should use linear regression instead.

Here's how you can specify the model in the form you requested:

r
Copy code
# Model data
first_model <- stan_glm(
  formula = Salary ~ Points,
  data = analysis_data,
  family = gaussian(link = "identity"),
  prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),
  seed = 853
)
In this model:

formula: Specifies the formula for the regression model (Salary as the dependent variable and Points as the independent variable).
data: Specifies the dataset (analysis_data).
family: Specifies the distribution and link function. Since we are predicting a continuous outcome (Salary), we use gaussian (normal distribution) with identity link function.
prior: Specifies the prior distribution for the regression coefficients. Here, we use a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 2.5 for each coefficient.
prior_intercept: Specifies the prior distribution for the intercept.
prior_aux: Specifies the prior distribution for auxiliary parameters.
seed: Sets the random seed for reproducibility.
This model will estimate the relationship between Salary and Points based on the provided data. Adjustments can be made to the formula and priors as needed.

User
copy this but include β3(Points) + β4(PlusMinus) + β5(PointsPerGame) fourth_model <- stan_glm(
  formula = Salary ~ Points,
  data = analysis_data,
  family = gaussian(link = "identity"),
  prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),
  seed = 93
)
ChatGPT
To include Points, PlusMinus, and PointsPerGame as predictors in the linear regression model, you can modify the formula in the stan_glm() function as follows:

r
Copy code
# Model data
fourth_model <- stan_glm(
  formula = Salary ~ Points + PlusMinus + PointsPerGame,
  data = analysis_data,
  family = gaussian(link = "identity"),
  prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),
  seed = 93
)
This model will estimate the relationship between Salary and the predictors Points, PlusMinus, and PointsPerGame based on the provided data. Adjustments to the prior distributions and other parameters can be made as needed.

  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE)
)
This sets up the model with the specified formula, prior distributions, and data. Adjustments to the priors and other parameters can be made as necessary.

Model Justification
We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular, we anticipate that both the wing width ($\beta_i$) and the wing length ($\gamma_i$) will contribute positively to the overall lift generated by the aircraft. This expectation is grounded in aerodynamic principles, where larger wings typically result in greater lift forces, thus allowing for longer periods of sustained flight.

Furthermore, the model posits that the total lift force ($\mu_i$) experienced by the aircraft is a function of not only the wing dimensions but also an intercept term ($\alpha$), which represents the baseline lift capability irrespective of wing size. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as:

​
 
Here, $\alpha$ represents the intercept term, while $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$ denote the wing width and length, respectively.

In Bayesian statistical modeling, we assign prior distributions to model parameters to reflect our prior beliefs about their plausible values. For our model, we assume normal priors for the intercept ($\alpha$), wing width ($\beta_i$), and wing length ($\gamma_i$), with mean zero and a standard deviation of 2.5. Additionally, we specify an exponential prior for the standard deviation parameter ($\sigma$), with a rate parameter of 1, reflecting our belief that standard deviation values are typically positive and right-skewed.

By fitting this hierarchical Bayesian model to the data, we aim to estimate the posterior distribution of the model parameters, which will allow us to quantify the uncertainty surrounding the relationship between wing dimensions and aircraft performance.

The goal of our modelling strategy was simple, using regression analysis and simple NHL game statistics to estimate what a particular NHL player should be paid. This is not a new concept as throughout sports, data analysis is used to calculate how much players should be paid. Since, teams began doing this, it has been controversial as arguments have been made about intangible
factors such as leadership and comradery. Many different models have been used have been used within sports all with the same goal, to find players that are undervalued to improve their teams. An extremely notable example of this is the movie, Money Ball, directed by Bennett Miller about the 2002 Oakland Athletics analytically approach to constructing their baseball team.  

## Model set-up

In this following sections, we present the hierarchical Bayesian model to predict player salaries in professional sports leagues, utilizing performance metrics such as points, plus-minus, and points per game as predictors.

\]
\[
\alpha \sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5)
\]
\[
\beta_{\text{Points}}, \beta_{\text{PlusMinus}}, \beta_{\text{PointsPerGame}} \sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5)

ChatGPT
We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular, larger wingspan and wing length are hypothesized to result in increased lift and aerodynamic efficiency, allowing the plane to remain aloft for longer durations. This expectation is grounded in fundamental principles of aerodynamics, where larger wing surfaces generate greater lift forces when subjected to airflow, thereby counteracting the force of gravity and sustaining flight.

Furthermore, empirical evidence from previous studies in aviation and aeronautical engineering supports the notion of a positive correlation between wing size and flight endurance. Research conducted on various aircraft designs has consistently shown that modifications to wing geometry, such as increasing span and chord length, lead to improvements in flight performance metrics, including endurance, range, and fuel efficiency.

In the context of our model, we anticipate that players with higher values of key performance indicators such as points, plus-minus, and points per game will correspond to higher salaries. This expectation aligns with the common understanding in the sports industry that players who contribute significantly to their team's success are often rewarded with lucrative contracts. Therefore, by incorporating these performance metrics into our model, we aim to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing salary determination in professional sports leagues, particularly the NHL.

Overall, our model represents a valuable tool for teams and stakeholders in the sports industry to make informed decisions regarding player contracts and salary negotiations. By leveraging empirical data and statistical analysis, we can enhance our understanding of the complex relationship between player performance and financial compensation, ultimately leading to more equitable and efficient salary structures in professional sports.

ChatGPT
We expect a positive relationship between plus-minus and salary, with a greater magnitude than the positive relationship between points and salary. Plus-minus reflects a player's overall impact on the game, taking into account both offensive and defensive contributions, whereas points primarily capture offensive prowess. Therefore, players with a high plus-minus rating are likely to be valued more highly by teams due to their ability to positively influence the outcome of games through effective play in both offensive and defensive situations.

In particular, we anticipate that players with a positive plus-minus rating, indicating that their team scores more goals than it concedes while they are on the ice, will command higher salaries compared to players with a negative or neutral plus-minus. This expectation is rooted in the fundamental principle of team success in hockey, where preventing goals against is as crucial as scoring goals.

Furthermore, our model accounts for the interplay between points and plus-minus, recognizing that players who contribute offensively while maintaining a strong defensive presence are likely to be perceived as more valuable assets to their teams. As such, the model seeks to identify players who excel in both offensive production and defensive responsibility, thereby providing teams with valuable insights into potential salary allocations.

Overall, our model serves as a comprehensive tool for assessing player worth in the NHL, considering a range of performance metrics that capture the multifaceted nature of player contributions. By quantifying the relationship between key performance indicators and salary, our model facilitates more informed decision-making in salary negotiations and player evaluations, ultimately contributing to the competitive success of teams in professional hockey.

Our results are summarized in Table 1 and the model results table. Table 1 illustrates the accuracy of each method to measure a player's pay, whether overall salary or their cap hit, against points. This simple regression analysis provides insights into the relationship between player performance (measured by points) and their corresponding salary or cap hit.

The coefficients presented in the regression models indicate the expected change in salary or cap hit for each unit increase in points. For example, in the Salary and Points regression model, the coefficient for Points is $43,107.99, indicating that, on average, each additional point scored by a player is associated with an increase in salary of approximately $43,107.99. Similarly, in the Caphit and Points regression model, the coefficient for Points is $81,599.22, suggesting a larger increase in cap hit for each additional point scored.

The R-squared values provide a measure of the proportion of variance in salary or cap hit explained by the independent variable (points) in each model. In both cases, the R-squared values are relatively low, indicating that points alone may not fully account for the variation in salary or cap hit. This suggests that other factors, such as player position, experience, or team performance, may also influence salary negotiations and cap allocations.

Overall, the regression analysis provides valuable insights into the relationship between player performance and compensation in the NHL. However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of these models and consider additional factors when making decisions regarding player contracts and salary negotiations.

The table presents the results of our analysis, showing the coefficients and standard errors for each predictor variable in our regression models, as well as measures of model fit such as R-squared, log likelihood, and information criteria.

Points: The coefficient for points is significant in all models, indicating that an increase in points is associated with higher salaries. This suggests that offensive contribution, as measured by points, is a strong determinant of player salary.
Plus/Minus: The coefficient for plus/minus is significant only in the complete model, suggesting that defensive impact, as measured by plus/minus, contributes to player salary when considered alongside other factors.
Games Played: The coefficient for games played is significant only in the complete model, indicating that player availability and consistency, as measured by games played, also influence salary determination when other variables are taken into account.
Overall Model Fit: The complete model, which includes points, plus/minus, and games played, demonstrates the highest R-squared value (0.419) and lowest information criteria, suggesting that it provides the best fit to the data compared to models with individual predictors. This indicates that considering all three variables together provides a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing player salary in the NHL.
Overall, these results suggest that offensive contribution, defensive impact, and player availability are all important considerations in determining player salary in professional hockey, with the complete model offering the most accurate representation of these relationships.

In both cases, the R-squared values are relatively low, indicating that points alone may not fully account for the variation in salary or cap hit. Ultimately, the R-squared value is better within the cap hit model and therefore used as our estimand throughout this paper, although salary and cap hit are often used interchangeably.

@tbl-modelresults presents the results of the complete model as well as multiple simple models. The first three models are simple regressions between one of Points, Plus/Minus, or Games Played and either Salary or CapHit.

In the Salary and Points model, the intercept is $1713785.76$, and the coefficient for Points is $43107.99$, indicating that, on average, each additional point scored by a player is associated with an increase in salary of approximately $43107.99. Similarly, the Salary and Plus/Minus model shows that each additional unit of Plus/Minus is associated with an increase in salary of approximately $27286.19$. For the Salary and Games Played model, each additional game played is associated with an increase in salary of approximately $60955.56$.

The R-squared values for these simple models range from $0.020$ to $0.134$, indicating that the proportion of variance in salary explained by these individual predictors is relatively low.

In contrast, the Complete Model includes all three predictors (Points, Plus/Minus, and Games Played) simultaneously. It shows a higher R-squared value of $0.419$, indicating that this model explains a larger proportion of the variance in salary. The coefficients for each predictor in the Complete Model provide insights into how each performance metric contributes to player salary when considered together.

Overall, these results highlight the importance of considering multiple performance metrics simultaneously when predicting player salary in the NHL.

For the Cap Hit and Games Played model, each additional game played is associated with an increase in cap hit of approximately $60955.56$.

It is important to note that the Games Played model may be flawed as it implies a linear relationship between the number of games played and cap hit, which may not accurately capture the complexities of salary determination in the NHL. Factors such as player performance, contract negotiations, and team dynamics can also significantly influence cap hit. Therefore, while games played may be a contributing factor, it is unlikely to be the sole determinant of cap hit.
