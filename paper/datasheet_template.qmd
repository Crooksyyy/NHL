Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset was created to enable analysis of NHL players. Specifically to estimate the value of players in terms of salary based of their staistics during the 2023-24 season. This dataset is indended to allow individuals to complete analysis that NHL team front offices must consider when signing players.  
    
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - Gavin Crooks, while studying at the University of Toronto. 
    
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - No funding was used in the creation of the dataset. The dataset uses publicly available statistics from the NHL (https://www.nhl.com/stats/skaters) and Hockey-Reference (https://www.hockey-reference.com/friv/current_nhl_salaries.cgi). 
    
4. *Any other comments?*
    - The dataset is not inclusive of all players but 448 of the top 500 scorers during the 2023-24 season. The datawas reduced from 500 to 448 from the availability of salary information. It does not include goalies as they require seperate analysis from skaters. 

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- The instances in the dataset represent NHL (National Hockey League) players. Each instance corresponds to a specific player in the NHL, capturing various attributes such as games played, goals, assists, points, plus/minus, salary, and cap hit for the 2023-24 season. The dataset focuses on skaters, including forwards and defensemen, but excludes goalies.
	
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- The dataset comprises 448 instances of NHL players, each representing a unique player in the league. Each instance includes various attributes such as games played, goals, assists, points, plus/minus, salary, and cap hit for the 2023-24 season. There is only one type of instance in this dataset, which is NHL skaters. Each skater instance includes performance metrics and contract details for a specific player in the league.
	
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is a sample of NHL players from the 2023-24 season rather than containing all possible instances. The larger set would encompass all NHL players from that season. The sample is not random but rather comprises the top 448 skaters based on their performance metrics during the specified season. While the sample size is relatively small compared to the total number of NHL players, it is representative of the higher-performing players in terms of offensive and defensive contributions. The representativeness of the sample is validated by the selection criteria, which prioritize players with notable statistics and contributions to their teams. However, it may not capture the entire spectrum of player performance and contract dynamics, especially for players with lower statistical profiles or those in specialized roles such as goaltenders.
	
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance in the dataset consists of raw data. The raw data includes various statistics and contract details for NHL players from the 2023-24 season. Specifically, each instance includes the following features:

Games Played: The number of games the player participated in during the season.
Goals: The total number of goals scored by the player during the season.
Assists: The total number of assists made by the player during the season.
Points: The total number of points (goals + assists) accumulated by the player during the season.
Plus/Minus: The plus/minus rating of the player, indicating the goal differential when the player is on the ice.
Salary: The total compensation received by the player for the season, including signing bonuses.
Cap Hit: The average annual value of the player's current contract, representing their salary cap hit for the season.
These features provide insights into each player's performance on the ice as well as their contractual status within their respective teams.

5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Yes, there is a target associated with each instance in the dataset. The target variable is the "Cap Hit," which represents the average annual value of the player's current contract. It is the main focus of analysis in the dataset and serves as the target variable for regression modeling. The goal is to predict the cap hit of NHL players based on their performance metrics and other relevant factors such as games played, goals, assists, and plus/minus.
	
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Yes, some complex statistics may be missing from individual instances in the dataset to keep the data simple and manageable. For example, detailed play-by-play data or advanced analytics like Corsi or Fenwick statistics may not be included. This decision could be made to streamline the dataset and focus on more commonly available performance metrics such as goals, assists, points, and plus/minus. Additionally, certain contract details or player attributes that are not readily accessible or publicly available may also be missing from individual instances. This missing information could be due to privacy concerns, contractual confidentiality, or data limitations.
	
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- No, relationships between individual instances are not made explicit in this dataset. Each instance represents a standalone observation of an NHL player's performance metrics and contract details for the 2023-24 season. There are no relational attributes or links provided that connect one player's data to another player's data or establish any form of network or interaction between instances. Each player's information is treated independently, without explicit relationships or connections to other players' data.
	
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- No, there are no recommended data splits provided with the dataset. Users are required to devise their own data splitting strategy based on their specific needs and objectives. Depending on modeling task at hand, users may choose to partition the data into training, validation, and testing sets using various techniques such as random sampling. Each subset serves a distinct purpose in the model development process, including training the model and evaluating performance, respectively. It's essential to ensure that the chosen data splitting approach adequately represents the underlying distribution of the data and avoids introducing biases that could impact model performance.
	
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No, there are no specific errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset.
	
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset relies on external resources for its creation, specifically the NHL website (https://www.nhl.com/stats/skaters) for player statistics and Hockey-Reference (https://www.hockey-reference.com/friv/current_nhl_salaries.cgi) for salary information. 

a) There are no guarantees that these external resources will remain constant over time. Changes to the structure or availability of these websites could impact the accessibility and accuracy of the data.

b) There are no official archival versions of the complete dataset including the external resources as they existed at the time of creation.

c) The NHL website and Hockey-Reference may have their own terms of use and restrictions associated with accessing their data. Users should review and comply with any applicable licenses, terms of use, or restrictions when accessing and using data from these external resources.

The dataset of the 448 players in available at https://github.com/Crooksyyy/NHL-Player-Evaluation/tree/main/data/analysis_data
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No, the dataset does not contain data that might be considered confidential. It includes publicly available statistics and salary information of NHL players for the 2023-24 season, which are not protected by legal privilege or other confidentiality measures.
	
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- No, the dataset does not contain any offensive, insulting, threatening, or otherwise anxiety-inducing content. It consists solely of statistical information related to NHL players' performance and salary details for the 2023-24 season, which are unlikely to cause any such concerns.
	
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- Yes, the dataset identifies sub-populations based on the NHL teams to which the players belong. Each player in the dataset is associated with a specific team, allowing for the identification of subpopulations based on team affiliation. The distribution of players across teams reflects the composition of the NHL during the 2023-24 season, with varying numbers of players representing each team.
	
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- While the dataset includes information about individual NHL players, such as their performance statistics and contract details, it does not contain personally identifiable information (PII) beyond what is publicly available about these players. Therefore, it is not possible to directly identify individuals from the dataset. However, if combined with other external sources containing PII, such as player biographies or personal profiles, it may be possible to indirectly identify individuals. Nonetheless, the dataset itself does not facilitate direct identification of individuals.
	
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset primarily consists of NHL player statistics and contract information, which do not inherently contain sensitive information such as race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions, or other personal attributes. However, it does include financial data related to players' salaries and cap hits. While this financial data is not typically considered sensitive in a broader context, it may still be subject to privacy considerations within the context of contractual negotiations and player management in professional sports. Nonetheless, the dataset does not include other types of sensitive information such as health data, genetic data, government identification numbers, or criminal history.
	

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
	- The data associated with each instance was acquired from publicly available sources, namely the NHL website (https://www.nhl.com/stats/skaters) and Hockey-Reference (https://www.hockey-reference.com/friv/current_nhl_salaries.cgi). These sources provide comprehensive statistics and salary information for NHL players, which were then compiled into the dataset. The data was directly observable as it represents factual information such as games played, goals, assists, points, plus/minus, salary, and cap hit for each player. There was no need for validation or verification as the data was obtained from reputable sources known for providing accurate and up-to-date information about NHL player statistics and contracts.
	
2. *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*
	- The data collection process involved downloading information directly from the NHL website and Hockey-Reference. No complex mechanisms or procedures were used; rather, the data was obtained through manual human curation by accessing the websites and downloading the relevant statistics and salary information. Since the data was obtained from official sources known for their accuracy and reliability, there was no need for additional validation procedures beyond ensuring that the data was correctly downloaded and compiled into the dataset.
	
3. *If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?*
	- The dataset is a sample derived from a larger set of NHL players. The sampling strategy used was deterministic, specifically targeting the top 500 scorers from the 2023-24 NHL season for whom salary data was available reducing the data to 448 players. This deterministic approach ensured that the dataset included players who were statistically significant in terms of their scoring performance, while also having salary information accessible for analysis.
	
4. *Who was involved in the data collection process (for example, students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (for example, how much were crowdworkers paid)?*
	- The data collection process myself, Gavin Crooks, a student at the University of Toronto. No compensation was provided for the data collection process as the data was obtained from publicly available sources, namely the NHL website and Hockey-Reference. Therefore, no crowdworkers or contractors were involved in the data collection process.
	
5. *Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (for example, recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.*
	- The data was collected on April 12, 2024, capturing the most up-to-date information available at that time. This timeframe aligns with the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances, ensuring that the dataset reflects the latest statistics and contract details for NHL players during the 2023-24 season.
	
6. *Were any ethical review processes conducted (for example, by an institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.*
	- No ethical review processes were conducted as part of the data collection for this project.
	
7. *Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (for example, websites)?*
	- The data was obtained from third-party sources, specifically the NHL website and Hockey-Reference.
	
8. *Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language of the notification itself.*
	- There was no direct notification to the individuals whose data is included in the dataset, as the data was publicly available on the NHL website and Hockey-Reference. These websites typically do not provide individual notifications to players regarding the collection of their statistics for public access.
	
9. *Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals consented.*
	- As the data was collected from publicly available sources such as the NHL website and Hockey-Reference, there was no explicit consent obtained from the individuals regarding the collection and use of their data. These websites provide statistics and salary information for NHL players as part of their regular operations, and users accessing this data are typically bound by the terms of service and privacy policies of these websites.
	
10. *If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).*
	- Since consent was not obtained for the collection and use of the data, there was no mechanism provided for individuals to revoke their consent. 
	
11. *Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (for example, a data protection impact analysis) been conducted? If so, please provide a description of this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.*
	- No, analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects, such as a data protection impact analysis, has been conducted.
	
12. *Any other comments?*
	- Professional athletes, including NHL players, are often under scrutiny in the public eye, and various analyses, including those related to their performance and contracts, are common occurrences.


**Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling**

1. *Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (for example, discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.*
	- Yes, preprocessing and cleaning of the data were conducted as part of the analysis. This involved merging and consolidating data from multiple sources, handling missing values, and selecting relevant variables for the analysis. For instance, missing salary information for some players resulted in the exclusion of those instances from the final dataset. Additionally, to simplify the analysis, certain complex statistics were omitted from the dataset.
	
2. *Was the "raw" data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (for example, to support unanticipated future uses)? If so, please provide a link or other access point to the "raw" data.*
